  - I Felt a Funeral, in my Brain
  - And Mourners to and fro
  - Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
  - That Sense was breaking through
  - And when they all were seated,
  - A Service, like a Drum -
  - Kept beating - beating - till I thought
  - My Mind was going numb -
  - And then I heard them lift a Box
  - And creak across  across my Soul
  - With those same Boots of Lead, again,
  - Then Space - began to toll,
  - And Being, but an Ear,
  - And I, and Silence, some strange Race
  - Wrecked, solitary, here -
  - And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
  - And I dropped down, and down -
  - And hit a World, at every plunge,
  - And Finished knowing - then
  - I felt a funeral in my brain by Emily Dickinson, read by Margot Hewitt
